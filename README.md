# CV-Instagram-Filters
Python remake of the Gotham Instagram filter

## Four easy steps
Using numpy, scikit-image, and a profound artistic vision
(required to copy the most popular Instagram filter available)


# Original image
A nice shot, but with a dull colour palette. Really missing a lot of
potential detail around the sky and clouds - also colours look
desaturated, and white/black balance is off on both ends.

# 1. Mid tone colour boost
* Lets add some vibrancy.

* Red snow and sky? I don't know about that..


# 2. Bluer Blacks
* Lets add some depth to the low end.

### Summary

The depth of colours around the boots is nice, as is the extra contrast on the snow capped trees. The increased vibrancy has turned the snow and sky an unwanted redish colour - the vibrancy modification needs to be turned down on the R channel. Vignette looks good however I think i'd like to see it even stronger.

Overall, it's turned a dull shot into a great playful image. All while maintaing true to the original Instagram Gothom filter.
