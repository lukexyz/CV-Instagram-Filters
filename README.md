# CV-Instagram-Filters
Python remake of the Gotham Instagram filter

## Four easy steps
Using numpy, scikit-image, and a profound artistic vision
(required to copy the most popular Instagram filter available)


# Original image
A nice shot, but with a dull colour palette. Really missing a lot of
potential detail around the sky and clouds - also colours look
desaturated, and white/black balance is off on both ends.

# 1. Mid tone colour boost
* Lets add some vibrancy.

</p>
* Red snow and sky? I don't know about that..


# 2. Bluer Blacks
* Lets add some depth to the low end.

# 4. Sharpening the image
Now look at those fluffy trees,

# 5. Blue channel boost in lower-mids, decrease in upper-mids

# 6. Finally, add a vignette for that vintage look

### Summary

The depth of colours around the boots is nice, as is the extra contrast on the snow-capped trees. The increased vibrancy has turned the snow and sky an unwanted reddish colour - the vibrancy modification needs to be turned down on the R channel. Vignette looks good however I think i'd like to see it even stronger.

Overall, it's turned a dull shot into a great playful image. All while maintaing true to the original Instagram Gotham filter.
